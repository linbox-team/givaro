Q: How to install Givaro?
A: Quick Start

> tar -zxvf Givaro.tar.gz
> cd givaro-4.XX
> configure --prefix=/tmp/givaro-exec
> make; make install

	Configuration can be adapted. > configure --help, will print the parameter choices.
	In particular if GMP is not installed to the default location you might need to add e.g. --with-gmp=/mypathforgmp/gmp-4.3.1 to the configure line.
	Also, on non-Linux systems you might need to use 'gmake' instead of 'make'.

Q: Compilation?
A: An optional compilation help file is provided : just add the following line to your Makefile !

include ##GIVAROROOT##/bin/givaro-makefile

A: Then a simple call will compile your C and C++ files  (here ifactor.C, with a gazillion number of optional optimization flags):

> cd examples/Integer; make ifactor "OPTFLAGS=-O7 -funroll-all-loops -felide-constructors -fstrict-aliasing -frerun-loop-opt -fexpensive-optimizations -fforce-addr -fforce-mem -fstrength-reduce -march=i686"


Q: Without the givaro compilation file?
A: You should add -Igivaropath/include to the CXX compilation flags, -Lgivaropath/lib -lgivaro to the LD link flags, toghether with those for GMP.
